I developed this theme because I wanted to have a lots of visuals to integrate any writing elements from my story directly into my notes. I created several callouts for that, and decided to craft a theme around this idea. This is how Fancy-a-Story came to life, an immersive writing experience where every note, every thought, every idea is part of a bigger story.

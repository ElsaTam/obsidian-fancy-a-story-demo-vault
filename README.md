Demo vault for the theme [Fancy-a-Story](https://github.com/elsatam/obsidian-fancy-a-story).

Based on the great community work [Theme dev vault](https://github.com/obsidian-community/theme-dev-vault), I extended with notes to showcase special syntax supported in the theme. You will find every new custom syntax in the folder `Content > Custom`.

This vault doesn't come with the theme installed, nor the Style Settings plugin. You will need to install them on your own computer.

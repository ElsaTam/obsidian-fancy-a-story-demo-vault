> I don't care if Helen of Troy walks in the room, that's Game 6!
> 
> **Sean**
> Oh, Helen of Troy...

> **Will**
> Oh my God; and who are these fuckin' friends of yours, they let you get away with that?
> 
> **Sean**
> Oh... they had to.
> 
> **Will**
> W-w-w-what'd you say to them?
> 
> **Sean**
> I just slid my ticket across the table, and I said, "Sorry, guys; I gotta see about a girl."

> **Will**
> I gotta go see about a girl?
> 
> **Sean**
> Yeah.
> 
> **Will**
> That's what you said? And they let you get away with that?
> 
> **Sean**
> Oh, yeah. They saw in my eyes that I meant it.
> 
> **Will**
> You're kiddin' me.
> 
> **Sean**
> No, I'm not kiddin' you, Will. That's why I'm not talkin' right now about some girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago and how I always regretted not going over and talking to her. I don't regret the 18 years I was married to Nancy. I don't regret the six years I had to give up counseling when she got sick. And I don't regret the last years when she got really sick. And I sure as hell don't regret missin' the damn game. That's regret.

> **Will**
> Wow... Woulda been nice to catch that game, though.
> 
> **Sean**
> I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit a homer.

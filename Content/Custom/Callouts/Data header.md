> A single slurk, the former guardian and only surviving remnant of the Stonescale kobolds who recently dwelt in the ruins, still lives in the pond. The mitflits enjoy playing "dodge the squirt": they taunt the slurk into spitting slime at them while they dash across the vine. The slurk prefers to sleep in the center of the pond with its snout above the water during the day, then flops out at night to hunt. Loud noises (such as a collapsing drawbridge), the scent of sudden free food (such as a tossed maggot steak), or anyone splashing around on the pool's edge will rouse the slurk from its slumber. Once woken, the monster eagerly attacks any creatures nearby, but it doesn't leave sight of its pond. The creature fights to the death.

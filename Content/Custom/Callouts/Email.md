> I can't go through official channels on this one. I found out where Emma's killer will be this Friday - old train station, locker 24. I want to catch him and take him down myself. Problem is, I can't risk having the cops involved. They'll only slow me down with red tape and protocols.
> 
> I need you there, just in case things go south. Your medical expertise could be crucial if anyone gets hurt, including the killer. I need to keep him alive. I trust you to keep this off the books.
> Emma's death is on my shoulders, and I have to make this right. Can you be there Friday evening, ready to step in if needed?
> 
> Let me know ASAP.
